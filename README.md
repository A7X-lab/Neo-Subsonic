# Neo-Subsonic

The code in this repository is a text-based Sci-Fi Runner with the goal of collecting instruments before the concert at an Art Insitute. You can run the program in one simple Py file. This program is a fun interactive way for a beginner to view many functions in the Python Programming Language. Functions such as while loops, if - else statements, and the dictionary all labeled make this program easy to view. Support by Downloading or leaving a comment.
